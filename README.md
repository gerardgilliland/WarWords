# WarWords
Code that looks at web pages and converts words on that page that reference war to bold.

Most people don’t see war and violence in our language (World Beyond War participants excluded.)
One activity that I have recommended in the past is take any on-line article or web page and bold all the war and violent words and phrases.
I wrote a program that will do that.
The following are the instructions to run WarWords and to request modifications to it.
Go to any online article or web page and copy the link.
Then open https://www.modelsw.com/wbw/WarWords.php
You will see the war and violence words and phrases.
Paste the link you copied into the URL text box and click Update.
It will display your online article or web page with the war and violence words and phrases in bold.
There is an email box at the bottom of the screen where the words are listed.
Please email me words or phrases (comma separated) that you want changed:
Add: list of words,
Remove: list of words,
Missing: a word that is listed and a link that you used that has that word but fails to bold.
Everything is lower case and singular.
I check upper case in the search so please don’t include words that are capitalized.
I check plural by adding an s so please don’t include plurals unless the plural is unique (knife, knives).
